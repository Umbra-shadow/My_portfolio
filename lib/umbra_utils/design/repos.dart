          '''Cursed , unlucky,worthless, lost, unworthy‚Ä¶ these are part of the thoughts that me a cursed flower has‚Ä¶ 
So hard to contain, so hard to water, so heavy to lift ‚Ä¶ am I just destined to be like this? In the dark? 

Judged for things that I can‚Äôt control, pointed at for being different, hahaha ‚Ä¶ is this what people call desperation? Despair?  Unable to take away the only thing that still allow me to go through this‚Ä¶ 

Pathetic, yes I‚Äôm that ‚Ä¶ weak it seems I‚Äôve always been‚Ä¶ so please keep on nourishing these feelings in me ‚Ä¶ maybe time will come for them to finally take the commands and guide me the cursed flower ‚Ä¶

Do I scare you? I‚Äôm poison after all‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a cursed flower‚Ä¶ , you water me less or much I die , you water me enough I get more poisonous‚Ä¶ hahaha I can‚Äôt wait for these feelings to change me into the deadly flower I‚Äôm maybe supposed to be‚Ä¶.

So keep on throwing acid on me‚Ä¶ even by ignoring my state, the need of a door out ‚Ä¶ darker I‚Äôll be and deadly you shall face ‚Ä¶.
