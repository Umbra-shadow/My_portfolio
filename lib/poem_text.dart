    title: 'Cursed flower 📓🗝️',
    poem:
        '''Cursed , unlucky,worthless, lost, unworthy... these are part of the thoughts that me a cursed flower has... 
So hard to contain, so hard to water, so heavy to lift ... am I just destined to be like this? In the dark? 

Judged for things that I can’t control, pointed at for being different, hahaha ... is this what people call desperation? Despair?  Unable to take away the only thing that still allow me to go through this... 

Pathetic, yes I’m that ... weak it seems I’ve always been... so please keep on nourishing these feelings in me ... maybe time will come for them to finally take the commands and guide me the cursed flower ...

Do I scare you? I’m poison after all... I’m a cursed flower... , you water me less or much I die , you water me enough I get more poisonous... hahaha I can’t wait for these feelings to change me into the deadly flower I’m maybe supposed to be....

So keep on throwing acid on me... even by ignoring my state, the need of a door out ... darker I’ll be and deadly you shall face .... ''',

    title: 'Always blamed for📓🗝️',
    poem:
        '''Just like this black water of the unknown river, I’m always blamed and accused .
They say that water is beautiful, that water is tempting, and look yummy and end up doing reckless things.
Forgetting that the sign 🪧 indicates use with precautions, danger existing so try to moderate, but no they call me beautiful and jump in me then curse me ,  insult me, and end up putting the blame on me for everything happening to them .

Am I to blame for what happened to you if you neglected the warnings? Am I to curse when you can’t do moderation and thinking?

Here we go again the blame is put on me, why are you avoiding guilt? Do you feel better like that ? If yes than enjoy because I’m just a black water in an unknown river .

I am coveted, loved, hated, cursed, and detested, so please enjoy cursing and lying about me … but just know that I have a depth in which all thrown rock land and get forgotten as a part of me, now it’s your turn to be .

Hey you who’s reading hear me right , I am a lonely black rose , I am lonely a black water in a unknown river, I can be poison or blessing, so come to me at your own risk , know what you want and not what you expect me to give because I can give life and death 🎬🖤''',

    title: ' Empty sound 📓🗝️',
    poem:
        '''Just like that pianist following the partition and pressing on the black and white keys of the black piano but unable to hear a single sound from it notes  , I walk and draw the corners of my life, darker than ever ,complex than ever and empty …

Where are you sounds of my notes, where are you sounds of my soul, why can’t I hear you? Why can’t I feel you… I’m sure that you’re there because other can feel , hear , and memories you . 
But why can’t I? Am I not worthy to hear but empty sounds ? You’re asking yourself what is an empty sound, it is a sound produce in a black and white world , a world where all you make is not yours .

I smile , laugh , jump and thank you for celebrating with me, but I’m just someone who can’t hear what he produces himself to make others this happy .

The more this emptiness fills my soul the more i disappear , the more I lose who I’m known as, I’m going, yeah I’m going , this as been a long journey , a journey where I’ve been looking for you …unique key with sound .

I didn’t find you anywhere I tried looking for, I can’t continue like this… that’s why I’m apologizing to you my long partner piano , because I have to leave you, but no worries I’ll never forget those happy moments where you never left my side , Tank you….

    title: 'Moon Flower 📓🗝️',
    poem:
        '''Your gaze 👁👁 is similar to this moon flower, which only grows at night and fades in the morning;
 Your voice is for me a thunderbolt whose sound is divine;
 Your body is bewitching 🤩 and loses me by making me forget my identity;
 I can resist, but I always end up losing in front of you;
 No matter how much we hate you, invade you, make you suffer, push you to die, you remain beautiful and one;
 This beauty looks like a luminescent natural flower that only lives to shine;
 You take the breath away of anyone who looks at you;
 You put at your service the kings of the peoples;
 I will gladly accept to be made rock just to continue to contemplate you;
 Words may be nothing, but your reflection in my eyes is even more expensive than the ruby itself;
 So please happily accept to be reflected in my eyes for eternity.''',

    title: 'Do I worth it?📓🗝️',
    poem: '''
  Just like this unique lonely black rose , which likes the darkness, I am seated in the dark and ask myself do I worth it ….

Hearing rumors of me being precious and unique , but when found and used becomes either holy water or poison… do I worth it, am I not just a dynamite…

It pains me to know that I can instill hope in you , hurt you to find me and end up being poison to you in just one mistake… 

It could’ve been easier if it was once … but since whenever someone cut me as the black rose , I grow back at the same place and repeat the same story…

It’s heavy , it is sad , to be alone because you can either give life or death , and since I don’t need fertile ground or sun to grow back I can’t find a way for my life to be taken….

Like a curse this repetitive cycle is drawing people perspective of me , I have been screaming from the bottom of my lungs that I am no good but it seems that my voice does not reach them, it is true I have benefits but my misdeeds are as present as my benefits…

How should I stop this , stop this shining black brightness of diamonds in me which pushes them to look for me ….''',

    title: 'the unexpected gift 📓🗝️',
    poem: '''
  Just like an unexpected gift, appearing like the moon  you are, splendid and beautiful… shining and tempting…

No one knows your content, but I am impatient to open you and learn from your heart what you want from me and what you can give.

I’m scared , I’m trembling, both of curiosity and fear, since I don’t like surprises, but for you I’ll make the effort.  You seem so unique, so lively and so tempting to be undercover yet…

Tell me … where did you learn how to smile? Because your smile paralyzed me but I’m happy it did, I don’t mind being this status brought into your secret chamber, because i would love contemplating you forever…

Fever ? Yeah I have that , why? Because of your voice , because of your smile , will I die because I’ve seen or heard them , I hope I don’t I still have a lot to find out about you a lot to feel, touch , taste and grab about you, weird isn’t it ? 

But I want that, I need that,  you’ve convinced me that I still have a lot to see a lot to learn so yeah come please and make me yours . ''',

    title: 'Beautiful as the Moon📓🗝️',
    poem: '''
  You , yeah you , I look at you and … no just know that as the moon … you’re a beautiful flower with unique colors;

Your shapes , your smile is nothing ordinary, It warm up my surroundings, it heat me up, listen I’m just but a man , I can’t display my emotions on my face, but know this : 

A word from you changed my mornings , a smile from you brightened my days , a look of you sent thunder feelings  right into one do my hidden personalities…

You’re just wow … I’m just maybe a newcomer in your life but yeah… I don’t regret doing so … I’m looking towards the sky and think about you, since you remind me of the moon , this moon which never stops giving me inspiration…

I want you , I desire you, I love you, I might not say it again and again but just know I’m sure you’ll be able to light up the candle in my heart 🙃so don’t give up ….

Beautiful as the moon , inspiring as it, beautiful as it, 😮‍💨😮‍💨 please give me the chance to breathe, and stop taking my breath away for a minute you the breath taking flower 😉…
